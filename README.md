# Dirty Dogs Hot Dogs

This is the solution for the Dirty Dogs code exercise.

## Project Notes

A framework such as Bootstrap was not used here due it just being a single page. The number of image rows in the header is reduced to 1 when the screen height is below a certain breakpoint so that screen real estate isn't taken up by too many images.

## Clarifications Needed

While completing this exercise, a couple inconsistencies were noted. These are issues that would need to be clarified by the designer or BA on a typical project.

### Misspellings

1. "vegetagian" in the Jumbotron.
2. "Gormet" in the all-beef section.
3. "Vegitarian" in the vegetarian section.

### Color Discrepancies

1. Blue dash next to the heading in the all-beef section differed from the other light gray dashes.

### Other

1. 2016 in the footer
2. Inconsistent use for "all-beef" vs. "all beef"
3. Inconsistent use of "Hotdogs" vs "Hot Dogs"
4. Use of "Registered Trademark" symbol in the footer instead of "Copyright"
